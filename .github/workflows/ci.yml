# This is a basic CI pipeline for GitHub Actions

name: CI Pipeline

# This tells GitHub to run the pipeline on any push to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# This defines the job that will run
jobs:
  build:
    # We will run this on a standard Ubuntu (Linux) virtual machine
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: This checks out your code so the pipeline can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: This is the exact same test script as before
    - name: Detect Code Change
      run: echo "CI Trigger Successful! A code change was detected in the repository."
