This file tells Docker which files and folders to ignore when building the image.
It's similar to .gitignore and helps keep the image small and secure.
Ignore Python virtual environment
venv
pycache/

Ignore IDE/editor-specific files
.vscode/
.idea/

Ignore environment files (we will pass these in securely)
.env
